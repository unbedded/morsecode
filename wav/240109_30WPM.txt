CWR REVERSE WITH THE CW MODE KEY ON THE TOP OF THE RADIO.  THERE ARE THREE
DEFAULT FILTER BANDWIDTHS 500 HZ, 250 HZ, AND 150 HZ.  EACH OF THESE FILTER
BANDWIDTHS CAN BE READJUSTED TO SUIT THE USER.  BREAK IN DELAY CAN BE SET
FROM 0 1 SECONDS IN 10 MS INCREMENTS.  HOWEVER, THE DELAY WILL NEVER BE
LESS THAN 100 MS DUE TO THE SDR SIGNAL PROCESSING LATENCY.  I SET THE BREAK
IN DELAY TO 250 MS TO MINIMIZE THE T/R RELAY CLICKING.  I OPERATED CW ON
40, 30, AND 20 METERS.  THE CW REPORTS WERE ALL EXCELLENT, WITH NO REPORTS
OF KEY CLICKS OR CHIRPS.  SSB OPERATION I OPERATED SSB A BIT ON 40 METERS,
BUT MOSTLY ON 20 AND 17 METERS.  TEN W IS A PRETTY MARGINAL POWER LEVEL FOR
SSB ON 40 METERS, BUT IT IS REASONABLY EFFECTIVE ON THE HIGHER BANDS.  THE
THREE SSB DEFAULT RECEIVE FILTER BANDWIDTHS ARE 2700 HZ, 2400 HZ, AND 1800
HZ.  AGAIN, THE FILTER BANDWIDTHS CAN BE MODIFIED EASILY IF DESIRED.  ALL
TRANSMIT AUDIO REPORTS WERE COMPLIMENTARY.  THERE IS NO SPEECH PROCESSOR
YET, AND THE ONLY TRANSMIT ADJUSTMENT YOU CAN MAKE IS MICROPHONE GAIN.
DIGITAL MODES THE X6100 CAN BE OPERATED WITH A COMPUTER AND SOUND CARD FOR
RTTY, PSK, JT65, OR ANY OF THE OTHER POPULAR DIGITAL MODES.  THE COMPUTER
