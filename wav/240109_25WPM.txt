INTERFACE IS VIA THE DEV PORT ON THE X6100, USING THE SUPPLIED USB C/ USB A
CABLE.  THERE IS A BUILT IN DECODER FOR RTTY, CW, AND BPSK.  THE RTTY AND
BPSK DECODERS WORK WELL, BUT THE CW DECODER IS STILL A WORK IN PROCESS.
CONCLUSION AND FINAL THOUGHTS I FOUND THE X6100 TO BE A VERY EASY AND
ENJOYABLE TRANSCEIVER TO OPERATE.  AND BECAUSE OF THE SDR ARCHITECTURE,
MORE CAPABILITIES AND FEATURES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE ADDED OVER TIME.
FINALLY, FOR SOME REASON THERE ARE TWO USER GROUPS HTTPS //GROUPS.
IO/G/X6100, AND HTTPS //GROUPS.  IO/G/XIEGU X6100.  ITS WORTH JOINING BOTH
GROUPS TO KEEP UP WITH OPERATING INFORMATION AND FIRMWARE UPDATES.  YOU CAN
ALSO JOIN A XIEGU X6100 FACEBOOK GROUP AT HTTPS //WWW. FACEBOOK. COM/
